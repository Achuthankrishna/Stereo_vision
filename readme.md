## Stereo Vision 
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of fundamental processes for obtaining stereo vision using OpenCV, without relying on external libraries. Stereo vision is a crucial aspect of computer vision, enabling the calculation of depth, correspondence, and disparity from stereo image pairs.

Please install OpenCV before running
For Codes,execute in terminal as Python3 filename.py
Given 3 files:
